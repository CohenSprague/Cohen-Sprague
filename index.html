                <h3>Custom Gaming Table Engineering & Fabrication</h3>
                <p>I designed and built a space-efficient modular gaming table, integrating a 55” digital display for a digital play surface. Using Autodesk Inventor, I created detailed 3D models and incorporated precision woodworking techniques. The table’s modular design ensures easy transport and setup, while the integrated TV elevates the gaming experience.</p>
