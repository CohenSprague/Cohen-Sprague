            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am seeking to work in the Engineering Technician field with a solid foundation in engineering technology, hands-on experience in IT support and technical sales, and a passion for problem-solving through coding and design. I am excited to contribute my skills to innovative engineering teams, with a focus on hardware diagnostics, system analysis, and technical problem-solving.</p>
            <p>In my career, I have worked on various technical roles, including computer repair, IT support, and custom engineering projects. I have designed and built custom systems and gaming tables, integrated new systems into platforms like FoundryVTT, and utilized my CAD and programming skills to solve complex engineering challenges. I am eager to take the learning and skills I have gathered to a professional career and explore each area more deeply!</p>
            <p>I grew up in Waverly, NY. A small village near PA. Technology was not the prioty for anyone there so I quickly found myself with the opportunity to grow my technical expertise by using knowledge I gathered to help others. My passion grew greatly as I continued this work. I started with simple techincal questions around the start of middle school. Then I started helping with some school functions like the sound and light system at our school auditorium which had recently been upgraded to a professional setup. Later I started helping in classrooms when a teacher had an issue if I had free periods. Eventually in my last year in highschool an E-sports team was launched. I spent a lot of time introducing students to the technology and setting up servers and match settings for our competative matches. During this time I also learned about the physical creation of projects from the engineering teachers at our school. I started with 3-D printing simple things and eventually started doing my own designs. I then wanted to make things that required other manufacturing methods and had Mr.Mills to teach me about proper use. Eventually I reached a point that I began forging and grinding to create things like swords in the school workshop where my principal began to call me "forged in fire" at any event. I continued with this work and started at a Home Depot to learn more techincal skills and aquire tools for my own workshop which I built in college at CCC. From there I took on varius projects and continued my technical work but at a professional level where I worked as IT and charged for things like computer building/repair.</p>
            <p>Unfortunatley, I had disaster in 2023. I was in college at the University at Buffalo for Electrical Engineering. I also retained a full time job at Wegmans and maintained my side work of computer/console repair. My father's health had declined greatly in the last few years and he became unable to work or do anything. We were never in the position that I could recieve financial support from them, but I did try to help them where I could. Eventually, I picked up hours and work until I had an NSTEMI (mini heart attack) at 23, which was suspected to have been caused by stress. I could no longer work enough to maintain my time and my health was in a dangerous place so I decided to withdraw. I moved in with my partner and spent an entire year just going to different doctors week after week until Finally getting back to normal with clears from all doctors near 2025. And here I find myself, trying to get a job in the field I would like to get back on track!

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>Custom Gaming Table Engineering & Fabrication</h3>
                <p>I designed and built a space-efficient modular gaming table, integrating a 55” digital display for a digital play surface. This project was particularly tricky as I was modifying our existing table. I dimensioned and transitioned all the old pieces into the new table keeping the costs incredibly low. Using Autodesk Inventor, I created detailed 3D models of both the old and new tables, and incorporated precision woodworking techniques. The table’s modular design was based off of Wyrmwood tables but with a much more personalized style. Magnets hold all the top sections in place and allow for extra space to be added using seperate table pieces with magnets in their base.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="project">
                <h3>FoundryVTT Custom System Development</h3>
                <p>In this project, I created and integrated custom automation tools for the FoundryVTT platform, enhancing its interactive functionality. This required me to build new systems from scratch and ensure seamless integration with existing features, showcasing my coding abilities and my capacity to work with complex systems. Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition is an incredibley complex system that requires countless hours to even begin to fully automate. I did not design the automation for the full system but for additional content that is not provided in the form of the Mystic class. This project was challenging because working around the system that was already set in place by foundry required an incredible amount of documentation understanding and trial and error.</p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>Custom Arcade Machine</h3>
                <p>When I first finished my workshop I wanted to build something large. My father loved video games his entire life and still often spoke about his love for old arcade machines in particular. I designed and built a custom arcade cabinet for his bar that allowed him to run all the games he wanted on one mahcine. This project required a lot of forward thinking and integration of many different systems. The system runs off of retropie but with custom integrations for all the decorative elements in the code. It was built 4 years ago and still gets played nearly every day.</p>
